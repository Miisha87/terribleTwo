            Two-year-olds have energy to spare, and don't quite grasp the concept of danger. This can be a potent combination that will likely give Mom and Dad a run for their money. These little monkeys may launch themselves off of couches, into swimming pools and out in front of oncoming traffic without hesitation. And, they're quick!
            When a two-year-old gets tired or hungry, or both, things can get ugly. Quickly. We all get a bit grumpy when we haven't gotten enough rest, or our tummies are rumbling, but toddlers haven't yet mastered the art of dealing with discomfort.

        <div class="col-6">
            When a little one is upset, it may be difficult for Mom or Dad to figure out why. Even two-year-olds who speak impeccably may scream hysterically when they don't get their way instead of calmly and rationally explaining what is wrong. Because...they're two. Telling a two-year-old to cooperate with getting dressed because you're running late makes about as much sense to him as a Shakespeare sonnet read in pig Latin. He has all of the time in the world. He doesn't comprehend deadlines or dates or why he has to hurry.
            is often frustrating for the both of you. He doesn't want to hurry and change, he wants to stay in his cozy pajamas and lounge for awhile. We can all relate to that feeling, but, when we get older, we realize that sometimes we have to keep our obligations and commitments. Two-year-olds who aren't cooperating with a morning routine or hurried grocery store run aren't trying to be terrible; it may just be that they don't realize what all the fuss is about.
